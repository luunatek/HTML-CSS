>>> Color

One of the most important design decisions you can make is your Web site's color palette. You should choose a palette before you begin designing to keep a cohesive visual identity. A common mistake it to use too many colors on a page. As you are starting out, it is best to limit yourself to just a few colors per page.

For a consistent look and feel your users will recognize, you will want to limit yourself to around 4 colors for all non-graphic content like text, backgrounds, borders, etc. There are different color palette tools on the Web you can play around with, but one of the best ways is to find a site you like the look and feel of and see if you can identify what color palette they are using.

When getting into design, it's a good idea to brush up on the basics of color theory, but just in case here's a short refresher. This is the color wheel:

Color Wheel
Colors make other colors

    The historical color wheel is organized around the three primary colors: red, yellow and blue.
    The secondary colors are the combinations of these primary colors: orange, green and purple.
    You can follow this pattern of varying the amount of each primary color to create infinite intermediary colors.
    However, as you've seen for the Web, we define all colors as combinations of Red, Green and Blue (green, not yellow). The short answer for this is because that is how the human eye perceives color, something that was unknown when the historical color wheel was made.

Build a palette based on the color wheel

    Colors that are across the wheel are called "complementary", blue and orange, red and green, etc.
    Colors that are next to one another are considered  "analogous" like navy, blue and teal or lime, green and hunter.
    When picking a color palette, you should generally pick between one that is comprised mostly of analogous colors, or mostly of complementary colors. Thankfully, there are lots of wonderful tools to help you do this! One we suggest is http://www.paletton.com/, where you can choose a starting color. It will generate for you a set of other colors that according to color theory will look pleasing together.

In your 4 colors, you'll want to keep a consistent tone so that your colors look good together. You'll want at least 1 very light color and 1 dark color. Avoid having all dark colors or all light, as often having contrast is important for readability. Also keep in mind not all users have full-color vision, so try to avoid too many similar colors.
