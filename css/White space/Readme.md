>>> White space

It can be difficult to strike a good balance of white space. The most common mistake beginner Web designers make is to not leave enough white space or empty space between HTML elements. 

You will want to make liberal use of paddings and margins to make sure that your site has plenty of empty space. Empty space makes it easier for a user's eyes to move around your page. You will want to ensure there is space between your HTML elements as well as between your elements and the edge of the page. 

Good balance between content and white space prevents your user from becoming fatigued while looking at your site. For example, when lines of text are very long, it is difficult to read without losing track of where you are. It is also fatiguing when the lines of text are too short because the user has to read vertically too much. There is considerable research on the topic, but a good rule of thumb is to limit lines of text to 50-75 characters wide.
