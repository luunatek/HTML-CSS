Hyper Text Markup Lanuage - defines the structure and layout of a Web document by using a variety of tags and attributes.

>> Three main sections: header, main, footer.

<!DOCTYPE html> — This tag specifies the language you will write on the page. In this case, the language is HTML 5.

<html> — This tag signals that from here on we are going to write in HTML code.

<head> — This is where all the metadata for the page goes — stuff mostly meant for search engines and other computer programs.
       - Common HTML elements in the head element include title, style, meta, link and script tags.

<body> — This is where the content of the page goes. The body element defines the main content of the web page. It's the viewable portion of a web page.

HTML Structure
This is how your average HTML page is structured visually.
Further Tags

Inside the <head> tag, there is one tag that is always included: <title>, but there are others that are just as important:

<title>
    This is where we insert the page name as it will appear at the top of the browser window or tab.
<meta>
    This is where information about the document is stored: character encoding, name (page context), description.

Let's try out a basic <head> section:

<head>
<title>My First Webpage</title>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="description" content="This field contains information about your page. It is usually around two sentences long.">.
<meta name="author" content="Conor Sheils">
</header>

Adding Content

Next, we will make <body> tag.

The HTML <body> is where we add the content which is designed for viewing by human eyes.

This includes text, images, tables, forms and everything else that we see on the internet each day.
How to Add HTML Headings To Your Web Page

In HTML, headings are written in the following elements:

    <h1>
        <h2>
            <h3>
                <h4>
                    <h5>
                        <h6>

As you might have guessed <h1> and <h2> should be used for the most important titles, while the remaining tags should be used for sub-headings and less important text.

When we write text in HTML, we also have a number of other elements we can use to control the text or make it appear in a certain way.
Other Key Elements

They are as follows:
Element	Meaning	Purpose
<b>	Bold	Highlight important information
<strong>	Strong	Similarly to bold, to highlight key text
<i>	Italic	To denote text
<em>	Emphasised Text	Usually used as image captions
<mark>	Marked Text	Highlight the background of the text
<small>	Small Text	To shrink the text
<strike>	Striked Out Text	To place a horizontal line across the text
<u>	Underlined Text	Used for links or text highlights
<ins>	Inserted Text	Displayed with an underline to show an inserted text
<sub>	Subscript Text	Typographical stylistic choice
<sup>	Superscript Text	Another typographical presentation style

These tags must be opened and closed around the text in question.

Links are included in an attribute opened by the <a> tag. This element is the first that we’ve met which uses an attribute and so it looks different to previously mentioned tags.
The Anchor Tag

The <a> (or anchor) opening tag is written in the format:

<a href="https://blogging.com/how-to-start-a-blog/">Your Link Text Here </a>

The first part of the attribute points to the page that will open once the link is clicked.

Meanwhile, the second part of the attribute contains the text which will be displayed to a visitor in order to entice them to click on that link.

If you are building your own website then you will most likely host all of your pages on professional web hosting. In this case, internal links on your website will <a href=”mylinkedpage.html”>Linktle Here</a>.

The <img> tag normally is written as follows:

<img src="yourimage.jpg" alt="Describe the image" height="X" width="X">



In web design, there are 3 different types of lists which you may wish to add to your site.
Ordered List

The first is an <ol>: This is an ordered list of contents. For example:

    An item
    Another item
    Another goes here.

Inside the <ol> tag we list each item on the list inside <li> </li> tags.

For example:

<ol>
<li>An item </li>
<li>Another item </li>
<li>Another goes here </li>
</ol>

Unordered List

The second type of list that you may wish to include is an <ul> unordered list. This is better known as a bullet point list and contains no numbers.

An example of this is:

<ul>
<li>This is </li>
<li>An Unordered </li>
<li>List </li>
</ul>

Definition List

Finally, you may wish to include a definition list <dl> on your page. An example of a <dl> list is as follows:

HTML
    Hypertext markup language is a programming language used to create web pages and is rendered by a web browser.

The code used for the above is as follows:

<dl>
<dt>Item</dt>
<dd>The definition goes here</dd>
</dl>



    Do not use a table to layout your website. Search engines hate it and it is generally a bad idea. Just… don't. See our CSS tutorial, instead.

This is definitely the most complicated part of this tutorial, however, learning it will certainly pay off in the long-run.

With this in mind, tables can still be a useful way to present content on your page.
What Does a Table Consist Of?

When drawing a table we must open an element with the <table> opening tag. Inside this tag, we structure the table using the table rows, <tr>, and cells, <td>.

An example of an HTML table is as follows:

<table>
<tr>
<td>Row 1 - Column 1</td>
<td>Row 1 - Colunm 2 </td>
<td>Row 1 - Column 3 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Row 2 - Column 1</td>
<td>Row 2 - Column 2</td>
<td>Row 2 - Column 3</td>
</tr>
</table>

This will produce a 2-row table with 3 cells in each row.

Tables can get quite complicated, so be sure to check out our special HTML tables tutorial.
Table Tags

However, watch out for these tags so that you can recognize them and use them as your skills develop.

Here are the tables tags presented in a table – pun totally intended.
Table Tag	Meaning	Location
<thead> 	Table Head	Top of the table
<tbody>	Table Body	Content of the table
<tfoot>	Table Foot	Bottom of the table
<colgroup>	Column Group	Within the table
<th>	Table Header	Data cell for the table header

Tables, borders, spacing are usually styled using CSS but we will cover this in a later tutorial.
Let's Make a Table

Go to a new line on the index.html page within your text editor. Enter the following HTML code:

<table>
<tr>
<td>Row 1 - Column 1</td>
<td>Row 1 - Column 2 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Row 2 - Column 1</td>
<td>Row 2 - Column 2</td>
</tr>
</table>


The final step we need to complete is to close the <body> and <html> tags at the end of each page using the following HTML code:

</body>
</html>

    In this guide, you’ve learned how to create basic HTML web pages.

<!DOCTYPE html>

<title>My First Webpage</title>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="description" content="This is my first website. It includes lots of information about my life.">
</head>

<h1>Welcome to my webpage</h1>
<p>Welcome to <em>my</em> brand new website.</p>
<p>This site will be my <strong>new</strong> home on the web.</p>
<a href="/page2.html">Page2</a>
<img src="testpic.jpg" alt="This is a test image" height="42" width="42">
<p>This website will have the following benefits for my business:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increased traffic </li>
<li>Global Reach</li>
<li>Promotional Opportunities</li>
</ul>

<tr>
<td>Row 1 - Column 1</td>
<td>Row 1 - Column 2 </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Row 2 - Column 1</td>
<td>Row 2 - Column 2</td>
</tr>
</table>
</body>
</html>
