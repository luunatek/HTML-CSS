Cascading Style Sheets. It's a language for providing style to HTML elements.
CSS can be defined inside of an HTML document with the <style> tag, or an separate CSS file.

body {
   background-color: grey;
   font-size: 30px;
}

1. Rule set
2. Selector { } - contains html element(body), paragraph, image, class selector(starts with .), id.
3. decoration inside {}
3. css property: css value.

CSS Units - css provides absolute and relative units to define length. It's expressed by a number value plus the unit. 
- font size: 30px;

Absolute units are fixed units, this will not change between different screen sizes (unless media queries are used).
media queries: cm, mm, in, px, pt, pc(picas)

Relative units are reliable to another property, thus will change between different screen automatically: %, em, rem, vw, vh, vmin, vmax(viewport max).
