CSS Units - css provides absolute and relative units to define length. It's expressed by a number value plus the unit. 
- font size: 30px;

Absolute units are fixed units, this will not change between different screen sizes (unless media queries are used).
media queries: cm, mm, in, px, pt, pc(picas)

Relative units are reliable to another property, thus will change between different screen automatically: %, em, rem, vw, vh, vmin, vmax(viewport max).
